# Object-Oriented Python

## Pre-Course Instructions

### Face to Face Course Instructions

This course will take place in an ICT computer room and so laptops are not required but you may bring one if you wish. Please make sure it is fully charged. This course will involve the running of Jupyter Notebook files. The easiest way to do this is to ensure you have a Google account. This will allow you to use the online Google Colab tool to run the notebooks on the day.

Alternatively, if you don’t have and don’t want to create a Google account, Imperial computers (including those in the computer rooms) will have Anaconda available to them through the Software Hub which will also allow the running of Jupyter Notebooks. You may also chose to install Anaconda on your personal machine by downloading the appropriate distribution from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

The presentation and the Notebooks may be downloaded [here](https://github.com/coolernato/Introduction-to-Python/archive/master.zip). If you want to undertake the course on your own laptop, you may want to download them. However, you do not need to read them before attending.

## Colab Links

The following are links to the Notebooks which will open in Google Colab. To use these links, you will need to log into a Google account. Once you click the link, you may see a page saying "Connected apps". If Google Colaboratory is in the list, click it to open the notebook. If it's not, click "Connect more apps...", search for "Colab" and connect the app before selecting it.
