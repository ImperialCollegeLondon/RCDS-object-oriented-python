Knowing about these principles will help you make efficient, maintainable and readable code. In addition, these principles are frequently the subject of interview questions for jobs involving coding, so a good knowledge of them is useful for interviews as well!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ot9EmZnZW8YL"},"source":["## Encapsulation\n","\n","Your code will typically contain many instances of many different classes. The design of each class should cause each object to keep its state private and self-contained. The contents of an object can modified and accessed through the properties and method of the class of which it is an instance.\n","\n","This means only the methods of the class can modify its data. This means these methods can ensure the integrity of the data. Furthermore, if there are problems with the values of the data, the fact that it can only be modified by a few different methods makes it much easier to diagnose where the problem occurs as there are fewer places to look.\n","\n","For example, imagine we're designing an action video game. We might have a class named ```Character```. The data of this class would include the health, stamina and armour of the character. Each of these might be accessible via a property, but not have a setter. Instead, they might be modified by the following methods:\n","\n","* ```swing_sword```: reduces stamina by a certain amount,\n","* ```damage```: takes an argument to specify the amount of damage being taken. Reduces the health by an amount calculated from this amount and the armour of the character,\n","* ```rest```: restores stamina and health to their maximum values.\n","\n","Checks can be built into each one of these methods. If the stamina of the character reaches zero in ```swing_sword```, another method could be called which causes the character to pass out. If the health reaches zero in ```damage```, another method could be called which causes the character to die. This would ensure that there is no way for the health or stamina of the character to drop below zero without the character passing out or dying respectively. This guarantees the integrity of the data of the object representing the character.\n","\n","Note that, as Python lacks the concept of private variables, which are completely inaccessible from outside the class definition, encapsulation cannot be enforced to the same extent as it can be in some other object-oriented languages.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YnAyL8jQh5ku"},"source":["## Abstraction\n","\n","Abstraction is an extension of the idea of encapsulation. Essentially, the complexities of what an object is doing should be abstracted and hidden from other objects only simple, high-level methods should be exposed for general use. This means that once the class has been defined, it can be treated as a black box by the rest of the code and developers don't need to worry about \"how\" it works.\n","\n","It also means that the class can be tested thoroughly in isolation as there are relatively few ways objects of the class can be interacted with, meaning there are limited things which need to be tested. The ability to test everything an instance of a class might be asked to do becomes very important in professional software development where reliability and a low error rate are important properties of good code.\n","\n","As an example, imagine a class designed to represent an aeroplane in a simulation. The actual class might contain very complex physics models representing how the areoplane will move in the air as it performs manoeuvres. However, its external methods may only allow the following:\n","\n","* Set the thrust of the engines,\n","* Set the angle of the rudder,\n","* Set the angle of the flaps,\n","* Extend/retract the landing gear,\n","\n","and so on. This means the rest of code will interact with these high-level methods and leave the calculation of the pitch, yaw, roll, speed and direction to the complex internals of the class. In fact, the application of encapsulation means the rest of code is expected not to interact with these data directly."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c8v-vstxcKJ3"},"source":["## Inheritance\n","\n","Many classes will share significant similarities. By using inheritance, we can group together common attributes of a group of classes into a \"parent\" class that the other \"child\" classes can inherit from. This allows the child classes to gain the attributes of the parent class with those attributes only being defined in a single place.\n","\n","A good way to think about inheritance is a child is an example of the parent. For instance, a square is a type of shape so a class representing a square may inherit from a class representing a shape. Attributes relating to shapes in general may then be defined in the shape class and attributes which apply to squares specifically can be defined the square class.\n","\n","This is a powerful way to minimise the need to reproduce code as common attributes only need to be defined in one place. This make writing and maintaining code much easier."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mWggN_hbitim"},"source":["## Polymorphism\n","\n","Polymorphism means \"many shapes\" in Greek. It refers to the ability for a variable in a piece of code to represent an object of any one of a series of related classes. This means we can write a piece of code which interacts with only the attributes of a shape but will be able operate on squares, triangles, circles and so on. This greatly simplifies code as a single piece of code can work on instances of many types of class.\n","\n","Because Python does not specify the type of a data a given variable refers to, the way this frees a developer in Python is not as extreme as it is in some other languages as it is a dynamically-typed language. This means, in Python, a variable can refer to an instance of any class.\n","\n","We can write the following piece of code in Python:\n","\n","```python\n","a = b + c\n","```\n","\n","and it will work if ```b``` and ``c`` are numeric variables or if ```b``` and ```c``` are strings. We never need to specify what type was expect these variables to be. In Python, code will work so long as the attributes used in the code are present in the data present in the variable as runtime. This means some of the importance of polymorphism in lost in Python as Python is inherently polymorphic.\n","\n","### Polymorphism in Statically Typed Languages\n","\n","In a statically typed language, such as C, C++ and Fortran, it is explicitly defined in the source code what type of data a variable will relate to. So, if we define a variable to represent an instance of a ```Shape```, could it represent a ```Square``` instead? The answer to this in OOP languages is \"yes\", due to polymorphism.\n","\n","For instance, we may write a function in a strongly typed language which accepts an argument of the ```Shape``` class. However, polymorphism means this value passed by an argument may also be a descendent (meaning it inherits from directly or indirectly) of the ```Shape``` class, such as a ```Square```.\n","\n","This makes sense. The code is designed to process data relating to a shape. And a square is a shape, so why shouldn't the code work on it? Inheritance is how we tell the code the relationship between squares and shapes, and polymorphism is the process which allows all descendents of shapes to be treated as shapes.\n","\n","This ability to have a variable reference a descendent of the class specified for a variable is of great value as it allows us to write code in statically typed languages which works on instances of a range of different, related classes that would otherwise be available in the statically typed language."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"688KXgEkUJZp"},"source":["## Questions to Consider\n","\n","Think about the following questions to make sure you understand the concepts discussed:\n","\n","*   How do these principles help us write code quickly?\n","*   How do these principles help us to write code which is easy to read?\n","*   How do these principles help us to write code which is easy to maintain/extend?\n","*   How do these principles help us write code which is easy to test?\n","*   How do these principles help us write code that could be used by others (e.g. in a library)?\n","\n"]}]}
