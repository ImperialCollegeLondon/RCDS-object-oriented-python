This is followed by the name of the class and colon which indicates the main body of the class is to be expected starting on the next line. It's conventional for the name of a class to begin with a capital letter. The main body of the class is indented. Once the indentation stops, the definition of the class has finished, similar to a ```for``` loop or ```if``` statement.\n","\n","In this class we've decided to include an \"instance method\". This is a function which will be able to access information relating to a specific instance of the class (we'll create an instance later to demonstrate this). The variable which represents the specific instance is passed to the first variable in the argument list of this method. It is conventional to call this variable ```self``` but this isn't strictly required. We may also have other arguments in the argument list, as with normal functions. This instance method is distinguished from normal functions as it's defined inside the class (as denoted by the indentation).\n","\n","Like a normal function, the body of the function is indented one level more than the declaration of the function (i.e. the line beginning with ```def```). Instance variable may access other methods of the class, access or modify data stored within the class as instance variables (more on that in the next notebook) or return value as with a normal function.\n","\n","When defining an instance method like this, the first argument is a variable which will be associated with the instance of the class when the function is called. This variable can have any name, but it's conventional for it to have the name ```self```.\n","\n","The method defined above reads from a instance variable named ```self.sound```. The period in this phrase means an attribute with the name to the right of the period of the variable to the left of the period is being accessed. In this case, the ```sound``` instance variable is being accessed.\n","\n","The indentation of the code finishes when the class description has finished. At this point, we create a variable named ```my_dog``` which is instance of the ```Animal``` class. This is done by writing the name of the class followed by a pair of parentheses. This nomenclature creates a new instance of the class and, as it is on the right-hand side of an assignment operator, assigns it to the variable ```my_dog```. We check the type of this variable and see it is indeed an example of the ```Animal``` class.\n","\n","On the next line we create a instance variable of the ```my_dog``` variable named ```sound``` and give it a value. It's possible for instances of classes to have many instance variables and this allows potentially large amounts of data to be stored within a single instance of a class.\n","\n","Finally, we invoke the ```speak``` method we created when we defined the class. Note that we only place one argument inside the parentheses despite there being two arguments in the definition of the method. This is because the first argument in the method definition gets its value from the instance of the ```Animal``` class to the left of the period where the method is called. In this case that means ```self``` becomes a reference to ```my_dog```. This means that when ```speak``` method accesses ```self.sound``` it is able to access the value \"woof\"."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ie7SXbtfEzqQ"},"source":["## Different Instances of a class have Independent Instance Variables\n","\n","When we set the value of ```sound``` for ```my_dog``` in the previous example, this created that instance variable for that instance of the class only.
