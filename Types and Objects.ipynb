    "As you can see, not only different values may be examples of different types, but functions, such as the ```print``` function and a user-defined function are also an examples of types.\n",

    "You may think of a type as a blueprint for a particular arrangement of data, although a type does not contain any data itself. The ```int``` type is a blueprint for the information required to define a whole number, but the variable ```a``` in the code segment above is an object of the ```int``` type with data which represents the value 2.\n",

    "An object of a certain type is sometimes referred to as an \"instance\" of the that type.\n",
