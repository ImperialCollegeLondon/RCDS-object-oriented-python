It's called automatically when a new instance of a class is created using the syntax ```[class name]()```. The name of the method is ```__init__```. Constructors are commonly used to set up the instance members of the new object. For instance, they may be used to populate instance variables which must always be declared. Constructors do not return a value, but instead set up the ```self``` variable, commonly using other arguments of the method to provide values.

This is a useful and convenient tool in many cases and opens up the possibility of some of the object-oriented design patterns we'll discuss up later. The other methods discussed are situationally useful and have been included here mostly as a demonstration of magic methods in general. As you learn more about object-oriented Python, you will likely become aware of more and more magic methods and their uses.\n","\n","## Exercise\n","\n","In zero-G, droplets of liquid will form perfect spheres. The natural property to parameterise one of these droplets is the volume of the droplet. Droplets may join together to form a larger droplet or split into smaller droplets.
