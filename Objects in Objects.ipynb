This means we can store a heirarchy of objects (these objects may be linked by inheritance but don't have to be).\n","\n","We might have a ```SolarSystem``` class with a instance variable called ```planets``` intended to hold  instances of the ```Planets``` class. Or a ```Computer``` class with an instance variable named ```processor``` designed to hold an instance of the ```Processor``` class. This means we can pass around an arbitrarily large grouping of objects with a single variable. In this notebook, we'll have a look at an example.\n","\n","We ca do this by using the fact that whenever we set a variable equal to an object, we create another reference to that object.\n","\n","## Example: Pets and Owners\n","\n","Let's imagine we have a person who may own pets. If we want to define a class to represent a person in Python we may want an instance of that class to hold references to objects representing their pets. Let's look at how we might do this. In this example, I'm not going to worry about using properties in order to make the example more compact."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8Q8vFHM7qo45","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1603461441506,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":552,"user":{"displayName":"Chris Cooling","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjoywtXOtodxpfl7grrq2lU3t3B4xn9dhcbyNsG4w=s64","userId":"16044721281026986520"}},"outputId":"29506233-ff83-4e4a-dafc-c8b2d98d8e44","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122}},"source":["# Define a pet class\n","class Pet:\n","  # It requires a species and a name to be defined\n","  def __init__(self, species, name):\n","    self.species = species\n","    self.name = name\n","\n","#Define a class to represent a person\n","class Person:\n","  # The constructor sets up an empty list of pets\n","  def __init__(self):\n","    self.pets = []\n","\n","  # We can later add pets and do this by appending the supplied pet to the list of pets\n","  def add_pet(self, pet):\n","    self.pets.append(pet)\n","\n","# Create a person\n","chris = Person()\n","\n","#Create a pet\n","tony = Pet (\"Tiger\", \"Tony\")\n","\n","#Add the pet to Chris\n","chris.add_pet(tony)\n","\n","#Check the properties of chris.pets\n","print(chris.pets) # This shows the array \"pets\" contains a single object of the Pet class\n","print(chris.pets[0].name)\n","print(chris.pets[0].species)\n","\n","#We can also check tony:\n","print(tony) # This shows us this is the same Pet object (note the memory addresses are identical)\n","print(tony.name)\n","print(tony.species)"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["[<__main__.Pet object at 0x7f6e09121a20>]\n","Tony\n","Tiger\n","<__main__.Pet object at 0x7f6e09121a20>\n","Tony\n","Tiger\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jOyKyvDawBh5"},"source":["This is useful - we can now reference the pet either in its own right, using the ```tony`` variable, or via its owner using ```chris.pets[0]```.
