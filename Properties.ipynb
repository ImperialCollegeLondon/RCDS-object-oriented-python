One such example is when we want to provide a way to set a value within an instance of a class, but we want to check the supplied value fulfills some criterion.\n","\n","Let's consider our square again. Let's say that, now, we wan to be able to change the side length other than in the constructor, but we can to check to make sure it's not negative, as a negative side length doesn't make sense. We can do that using the decorator ```[attribute_name].setter``` on an instance method named ```[attribute_name]```. This method should take two arguments, ```self``` as normal, and another argument which will receive the value being set. A setter with a particular name must follow a property for that same name found in the class definition.\n","\n","For our square class, let's use the variable name ```side_length```.

If its value is acceptable, it sets the value of the ```_side_length``` instance variable.\n","\n","Note that, when we made these changes, we had to change the name of the instance variable used to store the side length to ```_side_length```. The reason for this is that, if it remained being named ```side_length```, when the side length setter tried to assign a value to ```self.side_length```, it would call the ```self.side_length``` setter and this process would repeat and never exit.\n","\n","The reason we chose to modify the name of the instance variable by adding an underscore is that it follows a Python convention whereby the name of the instance variable accessed by a property/setter is the name of the property/setter preceded by an underscore. This keeps the association clear to a future developer, but avoids naming conflicts.\n","\n","This convention also warns a future developer that they should probably not interact directly with a instance variable with an underscore at the start and, instead should interact with the properties. In this example, always using the setter for ```side_length``` will ensure that ```_side_length``` never has a negative value.\n","\n","### Other Languages\n","\n","In most other object-oriented languages, there is the idea of \"private\" variables and, in many object-oriented languages, member variables will be private by default. Private instance or class variables are completely inaccessible from outside the methods of the class. This means methods, properties and setters become the only way they can be accessed or modified. This is important for the idea of encapsulation, which we'll talk about later.\n","\n","Python does not have the concept of a \"private\" variable. In the example above, we're still able to access ```my_square._side_length``` from outside the class and it's only convention which serves as a hint that that was not what was intended."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7hjNiCjQ4tZo"},"source":["## Exercise\n","\n","In the code cell below, complete the class named \"Temperature\" which is designed to hold a value to represent a temperature and to convert it into different units when it is asked for.
